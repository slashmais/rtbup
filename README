Compiling:
----------
To create and use rtbup, do the following:

1. At a bash-prompt:
	$ make clean
	$ make

2. Copy the executable to a directory where it will have write-access.
	E.g.: /your-home-dir/bin

3. Run rtbup once to create config- and log-files.

4. Create backup directories where rtbup can write the backed-up files.

5. Edit rtbup.config to add directories and backup-paths, and exclusion
   wildcards. (See 'rtbup.config')

6. Run rtbup in either the foreground or background. (See 'Usage' below)
---------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage:
------
You need to edit the config file to add monitored directories, backup-paths,
and exclusion file-wildcards. ("file-wildcards" is a comma-separated-list using,
'*' and '?', for files NOT to be backed-up.) Note: It does not (yet?) recurse
sub-dirs, and only backs-up changed files from the specified directory.
Then either run rtbup from the command-line:

	$ /-path-to-/rtbup

or, to start rtbup as a background process use:

	$ nohup /-path-to-/rtbup >/dev/null 2>&1 &

or, if the installation directory is in your $PATH, you can simply use it's name:

	$ rtbup
or:
	$ nohup rtbup >/dev/null 2>&1 &

You can restart or stop the backgrounded instance by running rtbup in a
console with the following commandline arguments:

	$ /-path-to-/rtbup command

Command    Description

restart    this will cause the background process to reload monitor settings
           from the configuration file and start any new monitors, or stop
           removed ones.

stop       this will cause the background process to stop all active monitors
           and terminate.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuration: (See 'rtbup.config' for full details.)
--------------
Setting directories to be monitored:
Format: monitor-path = backup-path | [ file-wildcards ]

e.g.: /-path-to-some-/workdir = /-path-to-it's-/backupdir | [ *~, temp.* ]
